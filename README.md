Go to the GitHub Repository:

Open your web browser and navigate to the GitHub repository where the file is located.
Navigate to the File:

Once you're on the repository page, locate the folder structure and find the Python file (or the file containing the code).
Click on the file name to view its contents directly on GitHub.
Download the File (Optional):

If you'd like to work with the file locally, you can either:
Click the "Download" button (usually a "Download ZIP" button for the whole repo).
Or you can clone the repository using Git if you prefer to work with the entire repository:

git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git

After cloning, navigate to the file on your local machine and open it in your preferred editor (e.g., VSCode, Sublime Text, or even a simple text editor).
Using GitHub's Raw View:

If you want to view the raw contents of a file (e.g., to copy it or analyze it), you can click on the Raw button located at the top-right of the file view.
